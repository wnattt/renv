\usage{
activate(project = NULL, profile = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{project}{The project directory. If \code{NULL}, then the active project will
be used. If no project is currently active, then the current working
directory is used instead.}

\item{profile}{The profile to be activated. When \code{NULL}, the default
profile is activated instead. See \code{vignette("profiles", package = "renv")}
for more information.}
}
\value{
The project directory, invisibly. Note that this function is normally
called for its side effects.
}
\description{
Use \code{activate()} to write the infrastructure needed to ensure that
newly-launched \R projects will load the project's private library on launch,
alongside any other project-specific state recorded for the project.
