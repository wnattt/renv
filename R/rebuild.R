#' Rebuild the Packages in your Project Library
#'
#' Rebuild and reinstall packages in your library. This can be useful as a
#' diagnostic tool -- for example, if you find that one or more of your
#' packages fail to load, and you want to ensure that you are starting from a
#' clean slate.
#'
#' Note that binaries will be used when appropriate and available for your
#' platform. If you'd like to force packages to be rebuilt from sources, you
#' can set `options(pkgType = "source")`.
#'
#' @inherit renv-params
#'
#' @param packages The package(s) to be rebuilt. When `NULL`, all packages
#'   in the library will be installed.
#'
#' @param recursive Boolean; should dependencies of packages be rebuilt
#'   recursively? Defaults to `TRUE`.
#'
#' @return A named list of package records which were installed by `renv`.

#' @export

#' renv::rebuild("dplyr", recursive = TRUE)
