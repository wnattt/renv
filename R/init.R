#' Initialize a Project
#'
#' Discover packages used within the current project, and then initialize a
#' project-local private \R library with those packages. The currently-installed
#' versions of any packages in use (as detected within the default R libraries)
#' are then installed to the project's private library.
#'
#' The primary steps taken when initializing a new project are:
#'
#' 1. \R package dependencies are discovered within the \R files used within
#'    the project with [dependencies()];
#'
#' 2. Discovered packages are copied into the `renv` global package cache, so
#'    these packages can be re-used across future projects as necessary;
#'
#' 3. Any missing \R package dependencies discovered are then installed into
#'    the project's private library;
#'
#' 4. A lockfile capturing the state of the project's library is created
#'    with [snapshot()];
#'
#' 5. The project is activated with [activate()].
#'
#' This mimics the workflow provided by `packrat::init()`, but with a few
#' differences -- in particular, `renv` does not attempt to download and store
#' package sources, and `renv` will re-use packages that have already been
#' installed whenever possible.
#'
#' If `renv` sees that the associated project has already been initialized and
#' has a lockfile, then it will attempt to infer the appropriate action to take
#' based on the presence of a private library. If no library is available,
#' `renv` will restore the private library from the lockfile; if one is
#' available, `renv` will ask if you want to perform a 'standard' init,
#' restore from the lockfile, or activate the project without taking any
#' further action.
#'
#' @section Infrastructure:
#'
#' `renv` will write or amend the following files in the project:
#'
#' - `.Rprofile`: An auto-loader will be installed, so that new R sessions
#'   launched within the project are automatically loaded.
#'
#' - `renv/activate.R`: This script is run by the previously-mentioned
#'   `.Rprofile` to load the project.
#'
#' - `renv/.gitignore`: This is used to instruct Git to ignore the project's
#'   private library, as it should normally not be committed to a version
#'   control repository.
#'
#' - `.Rbuildignore`: to ensure that the `renv` directory is ignored during
#'   package development; e.g. when attempting to build or install a package
#'   using `renv`.
#'
#' @inherit renv-params
#'
#' @param project The project directory. The \R working directory will be
#'   changed to match the requested project directory.
#'
#' @param settings A list of [settings] to be used with the newly-initialized
#'   project.
#'
#' @param bare Boolean; initialize the project without attempting to discover
#'   and install R package dependencies?
#'
#' @param force Boolean; force initialization? By default, `renv` will refuse
#'   to initialize the home directory as a project, to defend against accidental
#'   mis-usages of `init()`.
#'
#' @param restart Boolean; attempt to restart the \R session after initializing
#'   the project? A session restart will be attempted if the `"restart"` \R
#'   option is set by the frontend embedding \R.
